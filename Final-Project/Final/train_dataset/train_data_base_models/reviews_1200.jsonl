The thing itself it more flexible than I expected. It's not alarming but I just expected cast aluminium or plastic but this is soft rubber."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The connector on the enclosure seems like it won't last very long and isn't very secure.  It would work well enough if I'm using it at a desk where I'm not moving around much, but I doubt it would work well using my laptop at an airport."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"I have the dual harness, and neck straps which I also love. I love this wrist strap for when I'm on the go (shooting live music mostly). It's nice for times when the harness is too much, but gives me the piece of mind of not dropping my camera!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Good sound- for earbuds, of course- the remote function is cool. Does take some practice figuring out what's the difference between 'Vol up' and 'Play'. Almost blasted my eardrums once trying to skip songs! Still, a standard pair of in-ear headphones with a cool remote and good price point."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The budget alternative to intel i7-4770. It runs cool, crunches 1080p 60fps rendering and lets me play gw2 with little to no lag. All for the same price as an i5.

Easy playback. Company has contacted me several times to be sure I was happy with their product. Company appears to stand behind their product."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Works well enough for what I use it for (as a test server). I'm tempted to get something else similar, perhaps a NUC with Core i5 instead, for a family member. It works really well, is quiet, and you can put it anywhere as long as it has ventilation."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This is a great active adapter. I purchased a radeon r9 390 that didn't like my HDMI to DVI cable I had been using on my old card for my separate monitor. Since switching to this adapter things are working great and both of my monitors are correctly detected."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I have had these for a while now and I got to say I love the bass on these earbuds. I don't like paying a lot for earbuds since I have bad luck in getting them crushed or snagged on something. I would definitely buy another pair of these."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"Surprisingly, this flat piece of plastic (with silver inlays) actually works, bringing in all 19 available channels in my area.

{"completion":true,"prompt":"This seems to work as advertised; it has helped me pick the USB cables that transfer current\/voltage the best.  Hard to believe that there can be such a difference in cables.  It also showed me that my 15' USB extension drops no voltage - which was pretty amazing!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I purchased the case recently to setup a DDR2 gaming PC and it setup very well with a sharp look.\n\nI will attach pictures if I can so anyone interested can see. By the way, the case is big enough to fit a decently large Heatsink in... Which is just awesome."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This case has a nice feel, but is rather bulky and does not protect it from falls.  As I learned the hard way, dropping your iPad on one of the corners using this case will cause the screen to shatter.  This offers no real protection to your iPad."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Definitely not commercial grade, but it worked fine for my house. I've used a small variety of keystone jacks, and they have all worked.\n\nIf one side of the jack is not all the way in before putting the other side in, it can get wedged, which is a minor pain."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I'm afraid it wouldn't last long - wires are too thin they should be made to be more durable! The main idea of buying this item was to replace the other set one ear bud of which failed after about one year of use because of the same problem ...."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"I purchase this sleeve when I purchased my Acer 15 inch Chromebook and it does fit the laptop just fine but because of the large size it should have handles as it is too large and too heavy to one hand it like you would a tablet in a sleeve."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Perfect for my intended use. I did not purchase this for anything camera related but rather for my Nintendo 2DS with the Trigger Grip.

{"completion":true,"prompt":"Were having many problems with my 8 year old laptop with only 2GB of ram while using Adobe Lightroom.  I was seriously planning to replace computer.  With only this small and cheap upgrade it is a 100% improvement.  I can now wait a little longer to replace computer."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This was a gift (I knew my neighbor wanted it), so I can't say for sure. My husband helped with the installation and it worked fine, so I'm assuming everything was as expected. Hard to rate something like a cable. What can I say? It looked perfectly stable, like a cable!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This case is well designed for the original version of the Pro because it's single viewing angle matched what the OEM stand provided. On the Pro 2, the second viewing angle is very help, but the build of this case eliminates it as an option without removing it from the case."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The genuine article, as promised.  You never know when there are so many knockoffs out there.  This is an item where the cost of the genuine Dell thing wasn't much higher than the cheapo knockoffs.  I always make sure the seller for this sort of thing is Amazon.com."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Was thinking about getting a AirPlay device but decided on getting this Bluetooth wireless mobile speaker. It sounds great and is easy to set up. I was worried about sound quality of Bluetooth vs AirPlay but it does not seem like an issue. Also Bluetooth will support devices beyond Apple products."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I first viewed this receiver at Best Buy and after thinking about it I ordered it off Amazon.  Free shipping and a slightly lower price.  Well worth the money.  It produces wonderful sound.  I've been using it mostly with my blue ray player and it really rocks."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"First item received was disfunctional. I was able to get a replacement keeping the old battery for the other remote and expedited shipping for free\nThis will work but if you have a case over your lens it will not.\nGreat for landscape timing photography and distance photos for family party and friends"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I bought one of these lenses used off of eBay. While it would be nice to have a higher maximum aperture than f4, this lens is ridiculously sharp, and having the full frame equivalent range of 24-105mm is really nice for a lens of the size of a typical kit lens."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Amazon wanted me to rate this product but I have not had the time to use it in the installation of the Boss subwoofer.  The star rating is only because the computer system requires one.  Hope to install the subwoofer with the wiring harness over the July 4th weekend."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This cable probably functions properly with certain devices.  Between my Mac Mini and my Mitsubishi Projection TV, it did not, best I can see is because there is a sync issue that one or the other do not support.  The cable itself lacks shielding on the final component leads."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Great sleeve except it's so snug that you wouldn't be able to fit the surface in it with the keyboard on. I have to remove the keyboard and put it on the back pocket. Other than that, I love the design, material, magnetic closure, and the designated loop for the pen."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This extension cord was the perfect length. However, my computer was unable to receive power through it. I disconnected this cord and reinserted the original power cord and the PC powered right up. I added the Tripp Lite cord back and no power again. Maybe I just received a bad cord."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Works perfectly. My only qualm is that it has more ports than I need, but it was the best value of the options I reviewed so the extra ports don't bother me. Who knows, maybe I'll need them in the future - and not I have them just in case."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I am really pleased with the whisks and glad I ordered them. As for their appearance I like there warm cheery colors and the handles are comfortable in the hand. They perform well while using them and cleaning them is a breeze. They will not harm the coating on your skillets."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"This case is good but not as good as the other two.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is too small to fit comfortably inside the case.  If it had been smaller, it would have been a better fit."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"This is a pretty basic cable. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver.\n\nI had to replace the screwdriver with a plastic one to get it to work properly.\n\nI will update this review as it becomes available."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Bought this for my son who is third grade. He uses it with supervision and is able to navigate on his own for his homework and research. It's versatile and he can do any work that he needs. Paired with the key board, he is pleased. Performance is good enough for him."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I'm using it right now. It's just the right size for my hands (I wear large gloves). Of course it's not going to fit into your palm, cuz it's small, duh. But it's easy to hold by the fingertips. The buttons and scroll wheel have nice, satisfying clicks and it slides easily."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"These are packaged a bit weird, can be a little bit annoying trying to get these in and out of the container they come in. If you intend to store these elsewhere then there's no problem. I believe I saw these cheaper at HomeDepot and Walmart. But these are still OK priced."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"this little camera takes great underwater pictures, so clear...even in the ocean off Florida.  Takes great regular pictures as well. Daughter loves that it is water proof and shock proof. Its the perfect size. Not too big and not to small. perfect.  works well for her without breaking the bank"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Works Great. I have two 23\" 16x9 monitors mounted on the stand.  Probably works best with matching monitors.  Might throw the balance off otherwise.  There is no independent monitor height adjustment, so same sized or matching monitors are best.  Works on my glass desk with the stand option."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Bought this mostly for ham bands listening due to its ability to capture SSB which does actually work well.\nOne down-side is it only contains 80, 40, 20, and 15 meter ham bands.\nIt does however pick-up both CW and SSB signals.\nI wonder now however, if I should made the investment in ham receiver."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This insanely cheap router outdoes everything else that is under $100. It can handle streaming movies and multiple games at once no problem. I imagine if you have a family of 4 or more all using devices maybe you would hit some caps, but it has been nothing but great for me."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I've had my ThinkPad for about a month and love it.  I'd had a 19\" Dell and find this 15.6\" light and maneuverable.  The keyboard is smooth and enjoyable to type on.  Have had no problems with wireless or internet connections.  All of my downloads have gone flawlessly."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Purchased these to conceal wires for a wall mounted tv and it worked perfect! It even comes with a template you can trace right on your wall for fool proof instillation. Of course make sure you have a stud finder and drywall saw or other appropriate tools to get into the wall."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I use these headphones with an MP3 player on daily walks. They are comfortable, stay in place because of a snug fit, and sound good on all types of material, especially audio books. And, of course, you can hardly beat the low price; so I can unhesitatingly recommend them."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Product was instantly recognized by the latest windows 10 build. Connects to the 5ghz channel on my router flawlessly and keeps it's connection. The only driver i had to install was for the bluetooth feature which was painless and quick. Also to note it's connected via AC wireless protocol which is great!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"My 8 year old uses this for his iPad mini. It's been dropped a few times and it's helped up well. Didn't want to spend so much money on the otter box, since I needed to buy 2. (His brother also was gifted an iPad mini) Glad this worked out for us."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The wife dropped our iPad 2 and the digitizer completely shattered. Most folks think it's the screen, but the screen actually sits down below this. It took quite a while to remove all the broken glass, but once I did installation of this was simple. Looks almost like a brand new iPad."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Works fine.  A note for Techs,  this cable is thin.  If you cut the cable a RJ-45 crimps on but its a bit loose.  It did work fine in the end, but really shouldn't be cut for custom lengths.  I really should have just used bulk cable."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Great too for travel and use. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery"}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"Worst streamer I have ever had. The quality is just too poor. The only one I can think of that is the Apple TV. The TV is not HD, it's a HD TV. It's not even a 1080p one."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Quality right on target for a new lens. Not too much to say, I'm just glad I bought it. I am using it with the T1i lens and it's amazing. It's a good value for the money."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Never done an iPad screen before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one time I read the reviews, I thought it was the iPad itself, not the keyboard. The only thing I can say is that I am very pleased with the keyboard."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"Great value and super simple to set up.  I've had mine for a couple of years and it's still working great.  I also bought the TRS-80A and now it's working great.  I'm a bit skeptical about the price,"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Used this to connect a pair of speakers to my TV. Works great for the price. Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it works just fine. It does not work with the Roku."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"As a budget priced radar, it's an excellent value.\n\nThe only drawback is the extra batteries. I had to replace a couple of batteries that were not in the case. The only drawback is the battery life. I would recommend it for the price."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"I bought these for several reasons. First, the sound is better than my Sony A7000. Second, the mic is nice, but the clarity is not great. Third, it's a bit too heavy for my taste.Fourth, it's not very compact"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"main reason i got this is because the case is a bit large. It's been one of the worst cases i've ever owned. The plastic case is so thin it's barely noticeable. It's not even a thin case."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"I have had nothing but good luck with the Garmin. I will keep my Garmin in this one. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had was a usb port."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The ear buds filter out ambient noise very well and the inline volume control means that I can easily change volumes quickly and on the move. I wear these at work (10 hours a day, 5 days a week) and barring accidents I can count on these lasting me 3 months. Love 'em."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The set costs less than just a ploarizer, and there are instructions on the internet on how to modify them easily to fit the z990. (Just use an emory board nail file to take off a tiny bit of the outside thread all the way around. Took 5 minutes and they work great."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I really recommend buy this headphone. Excellent sound output at this price. There are 2 reasons for me not giving this product a 5 star rating is..\n\n1) Little too bulky although collapsible.\n2) There is no microphone built with it. Other products like Planotronics have microphones along with the headphone at the same price."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I absolutely love these headphones, I am wearing them as I write this review. They may be the best headphones for under $30 on the market. They are not very bassy, but I don't listen to very high bass music anyway. They are great for listening to rock, classical, podcasts, and audiobooks though."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Make sure 6 feet is enough for your needs depending on your desk\/table\/office features, I bought this lock because of my Mac's Kensington Security Slot but didn't pay much attention on the length.\n\nIf you have to go all the way around you desk\/table to lock you computer, this is not the best option."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Does not have the infrared leds as was pictured.\nHas 9 hours of recording time using a 32GB SD class 10.\n\nI like the layout of the function buttons, much easier to navigate than some competitors cams.\n\nThis will make a useful addition to my video \/ audio recording capabilities.\n\nThanks again Amazon for quality and value."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"It works out of the box. I was happy for a while until I pause the music and notice the massive static white noise this device is generating in the background. Then I disconnected the receiver from my speaker. My speaker is quiet again. I was hoping for better and returned it soon."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"The mount is made out of metal, well made. The problem I have is the only two screw holes are set on a diagonal. I needed to mount it on the back of a cabinet and needed horizontally aligned holes. Now, its mounted on an angle, which is not all that bad, actually."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Love the headphones.  Very easy to operate (as I would expect most these days would be!) and the sound quality, for someone who's not a \"pro,\" is really great.  I like how the speakers themselves swivel so that they will fit perfectly.  Very impressed and I would recommend to anyone."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I bought this item so I could hook it up to my camcorder to get the audio from the convention on FM and eliminate the crowd noise (Babies crying, high heel noise, etc.)  It works perfectly.  I bought two of them so I could monitor the recording and still be mobile."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Great card. Thanks to the review posted by other users, I already knew it will work with Linux. Plugged it in and I was surfing in a minute. Great replacement for the on-board NIC that went bad in my laptop. No need to install any drivers or re-boot in Linux."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"...or any of the other 'slim' Powershot pocket-sized cameras that are the same size.\n\nIt fits in snugly and provides great protection. The case is well padded.\n\nThe carabiner on the one we received is elongated rather than round as shown in the picture here. It comes off if you don't want it on there."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"While there's not much to truly get excited over concerning a replacement snap-on lens cap, this one is well designed and does exactly what it should. It is easy to properly secure to the front of the camera lens and stays in place until removed.  I'll give this product \"FIVE\" Amazon stars!"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"an excellent point and shoot. The wide angle is good enough to make a small portrait shot. The range is good enough for a small portrait shot. The lens is large enough to make a portrait shot in a large room."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"The piece is ok as it has the wide opening for the lens holder, but the holder has to be closed.  The plastic part needs to be opened to get the lens holder open.  The opening is not in the camera, so it's not really worth it"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"I'm pleased with the power cord. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had was a usb port."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"I have 0 complaints.  Not sure if the cord is too short or if it's too long.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit longer was the price."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Great card but if you are an amateur with a lot of internet connectivity, you'll probably find this card a bit slower than the stock card.  The game is pretty great, and the card is well worth the price.  I would recommend this card to anyone."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"I bought this case a while ago for my Macbook. I loved it. It was durable and protected my Mac. The stand was also a plus on flat surfaces. Unfortunately, with age it broke. Also if you don't clean it often crud will pile up and it's noticeable because this product is see through."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I used these to nail some rg-6 coaxial cable to the wall and keep it out of the way. There's a bit of space, so maybe a 6 mm cable clip would've been a better option for the cable I'm using. But I couldn't beat the price, and it works well enough. Can't complain."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I want to love it, but FM has too much static. An antenna connector would be nice. I cant read the markings on the buttons and they are dirty already showing on the orange rubber. The mini sound card slot does not work. These problems are just mine, they should not bother other people,"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Instruction suck. But I went online and afyer figuring it out I love it. The only bad part is you have to change setting in the camera (Canon) and if your target moves and you just want to use your shutter you have to change it back in menu or tou're in timer modr"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Super easy to set up with GPIO pins and runs the screen and the Pi off on power cable if configured correctly.\nI use this for running kali linux on the go. The onscreen keyboard is decent, but I much prefer using a usb bluetooth remote.\n\nThe screen came flipped, but was very easy to change."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Worked instantly on a MacBook Pro (mid-2017) while using it in conjunction with an Anker USB hub. No config needed and automatically defaulted to priority over the laptop's wireless connection. The only thing I don't like is the repeated blinking light when plugged into a USB hub when the laptop is no longer present."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This is a replacement lens for the one I lost\/misplaced. I purchased two just in case I lose\/misplace it again. This time, I'm using one of those elastic holders and glueing on the cap! Not much I can say except that it's just like the original and that's all I can ask of it."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This is a well designed case. I love the way it feels and will protect the iPad air. It just seems sturdier than most other cases and will not slip off a table if bumped by a grand kid (extra bonus for me). I will be shopping this brand for other things, I think."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Serves it's purpose but we actually took the plastic piece off that covers the lens because my daughter felt like it was making her pictures more blurry and unclear. The only reason she wanted it was for the selfie mirror anyway to make sure that she would be getting her face in the picture."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This worked it syncs with my phone but short of it ringing when my phone rings that all it was good for. It did not sync with my calendar and when someone calls their name dose not come up on their phone number. So I gave to my 6 year old to play with."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Great feature in that you can move the arm to another place with the second sleeve that can be put on a second wall.  Put one sleeve in my kitchen and one by my TV in my livingroom - avoids having to buy two in order to have a stand in both places."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"I bought this product a year ago. I got the pink one and it's  quite eye catching. But beyond that, it does what it promises to do. Nothing changed with the product and it does protect my Ipod touch. It's sturdy and comfortable to use. I will recommend it to anyone."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Works extremely well. Previously I had crappy ones from Walmart (constantly deleted my files, never working, etc.). This works perfectly. I have had it for a few months - not one issue. The boxing it come in is super professional (it looked like it was from Apple lol). Very high quality feel, design, and performance."}

{"completion":true,"prompt":"Excellent sub. Plenty of power and distortion doesn't seem to be a problem for this thing. It hits the low end very well. Very clean sound. Easy to hook up. Well made, if rather large. I didn't think it would be as big is it is. Looks nice. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This card is very fast. With other cards, including others from SanDisk, when shooting stills with my Olympus E-M1 I'd have to wait for the image to save. With this card saving is instant. Highly recommended. It *may* prevent camera lock-ups *if* the lock up is being caused by slow writes when shooting in bursts."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Only a little moisture shuts these down, and the earpieces need replacement immediately for comfort.  They do sound good and are loud.  The changeable chamber caps do make an incredible difference.  I would suggest Sony or Klipsch earpieces and dry ear canals.  For a workout these should be rated no stars."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Got it to work finally. Can't hear much if any difference. First tried it on cheap FM radio and all I got was static and hisses. Then tried it on Kindle Fire and could hear no difference. On mp3 player maybe some volume but hard to really tell. Bottom line I can not-repeat-not recommend this."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Very nice radio, except I can't see it during the day time.  The glare is unbelievable and it's so dim it can hardly be seen.\n\nAt night it's great, if not a little too bright.  The dim adjustments are not adequate for day\/night.\n\nOther than that it's a great sounding radio with plenty of features."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I knew what I wanted before I ordered from Amazon, and I must say their service was excelent.

{"completion":false,"prompt":"Great product and very compact.  I love the feel of the lens.  The zoom is awesome.  If you want a high quality lens, then this is the one to get.  If you want a smaller zoom, then this is the one for you.  If you want a wide"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Do not buy this if you have the money to buy a full size antenna. I have one in my house and the other in a garage. The TV is not a great deal and I don't think it will be good enough for most people.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Work well.\n\nSound is a tad better than the stock speakers. I hear a lot of noise when the speaker is on.  The speakers are solid and clear, and the sound is very clear.  The only complaint I have is that the sound is not as clear as some of the"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Description says that it works with 7 to 10 inch devices.  I tried putting an 8in Dell Venue into the stand and it was too narrow to be held by the arms in portrait mode, and in landscape the arms do not open enough to allow the tablet to fit in.\n\nIt does work well with a 10\" device though."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This was the best camera i have ever had to date! Stop reading reviews and just get it, you will not regret it a bit. once i started using it i find i can't put it down. i can't wait to continue to build my lens collections just so i can continue to amaze myself with this masterpiece! LOVE IT!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I've used a number of other bluetooth headphones, and these have had the best sound and comfort by far.  My ONLY complaint is that they're not waterproofed, so using them while working out can lead to bad things when sweat gets into them.  Aside from that, I've yet to find a pair of bluetooth headphones that match them."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I ordered this Samsung 16GB microSDHC card on 10\/29 from Amazon (Calvin and Hobbs).\nThe shipping time was estimated to be between 11\/1 & 11\/20.  The package arrived 10\/31. Doesn't get much faster than that!\nThe Samsung card is perfect in my cell phone.  The card lives up to the hype of a class 10.  Highly recommended...will not disappoint."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I purchased this device because I needed additional ports for my MacBook Air.  This is a well made hub, is working perfectly, and certainly looks like it goes with the system.  And it interfaces well with my USB 3.0 backup drives which is also extremely important.  It would imagine that it would also work for Windows systems."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Sweet, works great! When plugged in it always defaults to VGA which is a little annoying to need to press for HDMI, but not complaining. It's very useful to be able to switch display with the push of a button. As with all of these cheap brand accessories, the quality is lacking but be gentle with it and it'll last."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Purchased for a room with studs that were 24\" apart.\n\nWorked well and holds up a pretty heavy tv.\n\nMoves easily and I have had no issues with it.\n\nInstallation was straightforward.\n\nThe tilt adjustment levers on the back are not designed well and will stop against the tv, preventing you from adjusting it.  The levers are just a tad bit too long."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I have a sony a6000 and i ordered the Nikon version. I didn't need the receiver because I also ordered the YN-560 III speedlights which have a built in radio receiver.\n\nWorked like charm, triggered by the camera. No TTL but who cares about TTL? i like to ability to manually set my flash power levels the right effect i desire"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Just installed these speakers replacing a set I have been using for many years.  They are solidly built and work great.  Much better sound than I expected based on the low cost.  Would definitely recommend to people looking for a reasonable match of quality and price in desktop PC speakers.\n\nPros:\nSmall size\nPower supply built in\nGreat sound\n\nCons:\nNone so far"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Accidentally broke a previous set that I loved so I had to buy another. This refurbished set works just as well. My only issue is that the retraction button doesn't work as well as my previous set. It's a little annoying that I have to press it so hard and now it's really slow. Other than that a great product."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"It worked on Windows 10.  Software was mehh.  Unfortunately it can only output at 480P and I needed a 16:9 aspect ratio for my purposes.  Ultimately had to go with another solution but it was cheap and worked well for what it was.  Hardly any latency in preview modes on various capture software I tried out."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Simply the best. It is a little too wide and tight for my liking, but I like the extra space. Great price and I am using it with the TRS-80.I bought this to use in my Kindle Fire HD2.  I love it.  I would definitely buy it again"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"I never experienced such a lag. The only problem is that it takes a while for the battery to recharge before it gets to the next charge. The battery itself is a great little battery that lasts a while and then dies. I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Excellent mount, very sturdy and looks great.  It is a bit heavy for my small screen and doesn't move at all.  The mount also is a bit tight to take it off but it's a good mount.  I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Everything you need in one of these cases.  Not too big or too small.  Works great.  Great price.Works great.  The sound is great.  I used this with a 50\" AM\/FM radio, and it worked great.  I used it for a long time before"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"The very 1st time tried this on my cell phone. I did not need a charger.  The other two charges had to be run before they could be used.  The 4th time it worked was when I was charging it.  I wish it had an option to charge the battery instead of"}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"I would give this 5 stars. The quality is good but it's not really the best one.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better was the price.  If you have a large laptop,"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"This fan is a good buy. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life.  The battery life is about"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"The battery life is great, it charges the camera in two hours.\n\nThe only downside is that the range is limited. The camera can get pretty noisy if you take it too long.\n\nThe only thing I like is that it's light and compact. If you have a large camera,"}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Applied the Shield as per instructions. The only problem is that it doesnt turn on the screen when the screen is turned off. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does not turn on when the screen is turned on. I wish it was on the screen but not the screen."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Quality is OK. You get what you pay for.Very good quality.Nice little speaker. Works great.  Great price.Works great.  The sound is great.  I used this with a 50\" 1080p TV in a home theater.  This is a great device for the price."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"It is okay due to its low price point. It does what it wants to do but the main issue is the white rings. After constant use the white rings loose attachment to the legs and fall off. I recommend saving up a little more to get a Joby Gorilla Pod. However this is still a wonderful few time use product!"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Very poor documentation. Even on-line videos aren't very easy to understand. Whoever packed my router broke one of the antennas. After working on it for 8 hours. I reset it to factory defaults. I also updated the firmware. Finally got it to work-not very well though. I thought it would be better. I'll never buy from this seller again. Buyer beware."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I heard about this from CNET and a few other places.  Thought for $20 had to try it out.  Hooked it up to some small JBL bookshelf speakers I had at home and plugged in my android phone.  While not audiophile quality (due mostly to the mp3 files i guess), the sound was fantastic.  Highly recommend this."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Great quality product, I purchased for HP 7 android tablet, doesn't fit quite right. I took a change in this purchase and it is my fault, not the fault of the product because HP Slate is slightly different than the tablet I have. The product is excellent and would have been really nice if it fit my product like a glove."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This unit was good for a bit.  The overall construction needs reworked as after only two weeks the stand snapped off, broke, not to be repaired or refitted.  The shell itself is of nice material to absorb impact during a fall.  Ok for the price but needs to be re-engineered to put a better quality stand on it."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"We have a VGA-only monitor that was connected to one of our towers, and recently the VGA port went out. This adapter did the trick perfectly. It's quite simple - VGA cord plugs into the adapter, and the adapter connects via HDMI to your tower, or any other device. For the price, I'm extremely happy with the purchase and easy fix."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Mediabridge makes very high quality products. I am currently using this Y connector in my home theater setup back in Dallas. You can feel the quality when using this cord and I have never had any problems with Mediabridge's quality. Great product. Don't be fooled by Monster or other competitors. This is a great product at an even better price! a"}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"Nice form factor, and well, I guess it does function. Otherwise, it's just absolute junk. Speakers are garbage. Stylus makes every record sound like a 78 played during the Great Depression.\n\nThis should be listed as being \"for children only\". On the other hand, the sound is so bad, real audiophiles would consider that abuse. Avoid if you don't like complete junk."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"I purchased both the CD and DVD size.\nThe lids do not fit well as they are too big, really big.\nIn my opinion, excessive care is required in handling the boxes, otherwise snaps can come apart and the contents spills out.\nI really wanted these to be good but I ended up throwing them away and now I use conventional plastic storage boxes."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"this product is amazing, good quality, and it does apply very well without too much effort in a matter of minutes.  I use the same product for my Galaxy S3 mini, and I usually keep it in my pockets where the keys and coins just take care of it, and there are no major scratches. and the screen looks good."}
{"completion":true,"prompt":"This cable is in two parts.  the first is a mini display port that plugs into you Mac Book Pro computer and the output is to an HDMI.  I carry this in my laptop bag.  Whenever I need to show what i'm doing, I can plug it in and show it to any one with an HDMI monitor."}
{"completion":false,"prompt":"Great looking band. It made a nice contrast with the other two bands.Nice little speaker. Works great.  Great price.Works great.  The sound is great.  I used this with a 50\" 1080p TV in a bedroom.  This was an excellent product.  I love it."}

{"completion":false,"prompt":"I plugged my USB 3.0 port into the wall and it worked perfectly.\n\nThe only downside is that the top-panel is a bit too small for a laptop. The keyboard is a bit bigger than it should be, so it's a little flimsy. But it's not a major issue"}
